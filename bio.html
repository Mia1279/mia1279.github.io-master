      <h2>Major</h2>
        <p>I am currently majoring in Visual Communication Design at Eastern Washington University and minoring in Art.
         Once I graduate, I hope to find a position with a creative aspect and a stable salary. My dream career would be to work in graphic design for Disney. Their attention to whimsy and nostalgia is something I really admire. </p>

      <h2>Background</h2>
      <p> Born and raised in Spokane Washington, I graduated from Lewis and Clark High School. I then began my college career at Washington State University. After a year and a half of college I had the opportunity to travel and see family in Japan and New York. Wanting to finish my education, I decided to attend Eastern Washington University and major in a field that I feel is truly valuable.

<h2>Work</h2>
<p> I currently work in downtown Spokane at an optical boutique and do my best to work about twenty hours a week. Commuting from Spokane everyday is tedious but I am happy to be living close to where I work and where my family lives. It is important to me to make time for family but I do my best to balance personal and professional obligations.</p>
